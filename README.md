# Aplikacja XML
The XML application allows you to save data from tables to XML files and then display them in XML format. It also offers the opposite option, i.e. saving data from XML format to tables in the database.
# Generator Danych
The data generator was written in C# and allows you to generate data and save it to tables by connecting to the database in advance. Generating data involves creating classes with data, which then create records for the appropriate tables.
# Symulator Aplikacji
The Application Simulator works in a similar way to the Data Generator, but it is written in Python. It allows you to connect to an Oracle database and generate data for tables from the database
